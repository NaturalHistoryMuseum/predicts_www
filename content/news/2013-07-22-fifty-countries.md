Title: 50<sup>th</sup> country!

The database now has biodiversity data from studies in 50 countries,
with [Marin-Spiotta et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1268)]'s
2007 study of reforestation in Puerto Rico being the latest addition.
Colombia remains that country with most data sets (22), while the USA
leads in numbers of sites (1096). There are still some big gaps though
- no data sets from Russia yet, despite it being the largest country in
the world, and four of Conservation International's 17 'megadiverse'
nations are still not represented - Bolivia, Democratic Republic of
Congo, Philippines and Venezuela. If you have any suitable data sets,
please let us know!
