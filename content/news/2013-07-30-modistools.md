Title: MODISTools R package released

Two of the PREDICTS team - Sean Tuck (MSc 2011-2012, currently
completing a PhD at Oxford) and Helen Phillips (MSc 2011-2012,
currently completing a PREDICTS-related PhD at Imperial) - recently
released the
[MODISTools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MODISTools/index.html) R package. MODISTools fetches data from the
NASA's archive of [MODIS](http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
(Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data -
complete coverage of the whole of the Earth every 1 to 2 days at 36
spectral bands. The MODIS data are processed by NASA into products that
provide information about areas such as land surface temperature, snow
cover and vegetation indices. MODIS data are increasingly widely used
in ecological studies and PREDICTS uses the MODIS vegetation indices
products to assess both changes in and loss of habitats.

The MODISTools package allows subsets of the MODIS products of interest
to be downloaded and stored using just a single line of code, avoiding
time consuming and often error-prone manual steps. The PREDICTS team
have found MODISTools to be invaluable. The package can be installed in
R by running: `install.packages('MODISTools')`.
