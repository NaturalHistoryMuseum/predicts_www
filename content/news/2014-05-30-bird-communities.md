Title: Projecting the composition and diversity of bird communities in the present and future

[Tim Newbold]({filename}/pages/team.md#TN) and
[Jorn Scharlemann]({filename}/pages/team.md#JS) recently published a
[paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.12186) using
trait-based models of the response of bird species
occurrence and abundance to land-use change to project the
composition and diversity of whole bird assemblages in tropical
forests. This paper shows that past land-use change has led to
bird assemblages becoming - on average - less diverse, and also
composed of a smaller abundance of certain guilds (nectarivores,
frugivores and insectivores) and a larger abundance of others
(especially generalist herbivores). The paper also generates
future projections, showing that these past trends are likely to
continue into the future under a business-as-usual scenario.
While not directly a product of the PREDICTS project, the models
underlying this paper used data from studies that have since been
entered into the PREDICTS database. It also demonstrates how
models like those being developed in the PREDICTS project can be
used to infer changes in the structure and diversity of
ecological assemblages.
