Title: BES 2012 Meeting

Dr Tim Newbold will be talking about PREDICTS at the 2012 annual
meeting of the British Ecological Society.

Taxonomic and functional patterns in the response of species to land-use change

> Land-use change is the primary driver of biodiversity loss. Different
> taxonomic and functional groups of organisms respond  differently to
> land-use change, with implications for ecosystem structure and
> function. We illustrate taxonomic and functional patterns in responses
> to land-use using the global database on community abundance
> composition of the PREDICTS (Predicting Responses of Ecological
> Diversity to Change in Terrestrial Systems) project.
