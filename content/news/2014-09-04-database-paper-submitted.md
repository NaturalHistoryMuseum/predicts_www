Title: Database paper submitted

We have just submitted the manuscript that describes the PREDICTS
database for open-access publication in
[Ecology and Evolution](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2045-7758)
The manuscript fully describes how the database was designed,
populated and validated. The manuscript presents assessments of
the data's taxonomic, geographic and temporal coverage, based on a
snapshot of the database taken at the end of March this year, at
which time the database contained 1.6 million samples taken in 78
countries and representing over 28,000 species. Alongside the
manuscript, we will make available a site-level summary dataset
that contains, for each sampling location, the predominant
habitat, land-use intensity, type of habitat fragmentation,
geographic coordinates, sampling dates, country, biogeographic
realm, ecoregion, biome, biodiversity hotspot, taxonomic group
studied and the number of measurements taken.

A massive thank-you to everybody who generously contributed their
data and to all who provided comments on the draft of the
manuscript. Apologies to those who have contributed data to PREDICTS
that were not loaded into the database before the end of March. We
will focus on processing these data in time to include them in the
first public release of the database next year. Everyone who has
provided data that we release will be offered authorship on an
accompanying paper.
