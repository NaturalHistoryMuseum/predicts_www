Title: Half a million records!

The PREDICTS database has just received its 500,000<sup>th</sup>
record! Dan Ingram uploaded the data from
[Naidoo (2004) Anim. Conserv.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1367943003001185),
a study of bird communities at 96 sites in Uganda. We also passed the
10,000 species mark yesterday afternoon, and have also gone past 6,000
within-study sites. Thanks again to everyone who's shared data with us,
enabling us to get such good representation. We're always looking for
more data, though, so please do pass the word on to anyone you know who
might like to contribute.
