The PREDICTS database has topped 500 studies and 2 million records this week.
[Susan Emerson](/pages/team.html#SE) uploaded the 500<sup>th</sup> study, from
[a recent paper on Himalayan Chinese birds](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.06.014);
the photo shows her between pressing the "Submit" button and receiving the
initial validation errors!
Only three hours later,
[Katia Sanchez Ortiz](/pages/team.html#KSO) uploaded
[a study of Hawaiian parasitoid wasps](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059356),
which took us above the magic two million mark.

We reached two other significant milestones this week.
First, the database now contains measurements of just over
3,000 species of birds - more than 30% of formally described species.
Second, over 550 mammals are represented - just over 10% of
described mammalian species. The PREDICTS database now contains biodiversity
measurements from more than 34,000 species, taken in 88 countries.
The [outputs](/pages/outputs.html) page has a map of sampling
locations. Massive thanks to everyone who has shared their data with us!
