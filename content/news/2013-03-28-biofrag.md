Title: BioFrag - helping to understand effects of forest fragmentation on biodiversity

[BioFrag](http://biofrag.wordpress.com/) is a
biodiversity-based indicator of the impact of forest fragmentation,
coming out of a project led by PREDICTS co-Investigator
[Dr Rob Ewers](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.ewers).
Some of the PREDICTS data sets are relevant to BioFrag too so, if
you've provided us with data, BioFrag might be in touch too - we've
let them know contact details but obviously not passed any data sets
on.
