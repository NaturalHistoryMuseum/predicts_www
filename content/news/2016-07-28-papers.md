Title: Two PREDICTS papers published this month in Science and Nature Communications

This month sees the publication of two PREDICTS papers, one in
Science and one in Nature Communications.
The Science paper:
[*Has land use pushed terrestrial biodiversity beyond the planetary boundary? A global assessment*](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6296/288.short)
shows how the PREDICTS database, compiled from the data generously donated by
hundreds of scientists, has been used to assess the global status of biodiversity.
The study reveals that 58% of the world's land coverage already falls below a safe level.

The paper published in Nature Communications
[*Local biodiversity is higher inside than outside terrestrial protected areas worldwide*](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12306),
is the largest global analysis of biodiversity in protected areas and the study
shows that protected area do benefit a broad range of species. This work was
achieved through the integration of data within the PREDICTS database and the
[World Database on Protected Areas](http://www.protectedplanet.net/).
