Title: PhD studentship available, deadline 20<sup>th</sup> January 2014

A NERC-funded PhD studentship is available, related to the PREDICTS
project, to be based in Andy Purvis's lab at the
[Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk).
The topic is statistical modelling of how soil biodiversity and
ecosystem function respond to human impacts in UK ecosystems. Paul
Eggleton (NHM) and Tom Bell (Imperial) will be cosupervisors. The
studentship will aim to combine new data collection, Citizen
Science approaches, analysis of existing data already in hand from
monitoring and survey projects around the UK, and compilation of
already-published data from similar biomes worldwide. It will
develop data-rich and policy-relevant models of how soil and litter
community composition and rates of ecosystem processes will respond
to predicted future changes in land use in the UK. Questions
include:

* Are biotic responses consistent among major taxa, guilds and habitats, and can
    any differences be explained?
* Do spatial comparisons and time series data give the same results?
* How important is biodiversity per se – rather than land use and
    management – in shaping ecosystem function?
