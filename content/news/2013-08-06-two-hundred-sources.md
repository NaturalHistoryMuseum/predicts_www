Title: 200th data source!

We've had an amazing month for data, averaging over 10,000 new records
per day through July, and data from the 200th source -
[Hatfield & LeBuhn](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2007.06.019)'s
2007 study of bumble bees in montane meadows - has just been uploaded
to the PREDICTS database. Fittingly, it was Adriana who uploaded it -
she's now responsible for over 3,000 of the sites for which we have
data. We're expecting data collection to slack off a bit soon, as many
of the team are nearing the end of their Masters projects, but there
are a few milestones we're hoping to reach this month - 10,000 sites,
20,000 species, and a million records overall.
