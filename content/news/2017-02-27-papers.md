Title:Two PREDICTS  papers published in Advances in Ecological Research this month

This month sees two chapters in Advances in Ecological Research (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/00652504) produced by the PREDICTS team and collaborators! 
Chapter four: “Challenges With Inferring How Land-Use Affects Terrestrial Biodiversity: Study Design, Time, Space and Synthesis”, syntheses the advantages *and* challenges that *different* study designs face, *including spatial comparisons (e.g. those collated in PREDICTS v1) and temporal designs (e.g. those used in PREDICTS v2).*
Chapter five: “Modelling and Projecting the Response of Local Terrestrial Biodiversity Worldwide to Land Use and Related Pressures: The PREDICTS Project”, discuss the motivations *behind the* PREDICTS project, its *protocols*, and key decisions that helped to reach its objectives.
