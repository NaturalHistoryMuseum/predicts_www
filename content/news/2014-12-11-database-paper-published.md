Title: PREDICTS database paper published!

The paper describing the PREDICTS database as of March 2014 has been
accepted for open-access publication in Ecology and Evolution and is
available on their [Early View](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1303) page.
A massive thank-you to all who contributed their data  to the
database! If you would like to see what has been said about the
paper, you can look at the Twitter hashtag
[#PredictsProject](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PredictsProject).

Next year we will seek to publish a further open-access paper to
accompany the first release of the biodiversity data themselves.
