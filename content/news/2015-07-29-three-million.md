Title: PREDICTS reaches 3 million data points

Thanks to an upload by [Victoria Burton](/pages/team.html#VB), with a
[study on soil invertebrates](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01433.x),
the PREDICTS database now has over 3 million records! We have measurements in
every major biome, every mega-diverse country and all but of one of the
recognised biodiversity hotspots. These achievements have only been possible
because of the generous contributions of data providers from all over the world:
thank you!
