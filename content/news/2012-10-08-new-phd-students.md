Title: New PhD students starting

Welcome to Helen Phillips, who starts her PhD today funded by a Hans
Rausing PhD Scholarship.  She was awarded a Distinction for her MSc in
Ecology, Evolution and Conservation at Imperial this year, undertaking
a project that was part of PREDICTS, so she's already an old hand;
before her MSc, she did a BSc in Zoology at the University of Liverpool.
Part of her PhD research, on modelling biodiversity responses to human
impacts, will be within the PREDICTS project.
