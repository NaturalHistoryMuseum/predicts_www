Title: PREDICTS database released!

We are delighted to announce the publication of the first full release of the
PREDICTS database! The data themselves are freely available via the
[Natural History Museum’s data portal](http://dx.doi.org/10.5519/0066354),
and the accompanying paper – with 515 authors from 61 countries – is now online
at [Ecology & Evolution](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2579).
This version of the database includes data added to the database prior to March
2016; the most recent 25 datasets added to the database are therefore not
included in this release or this paper, but will instead feature in a future
update release. Thanks so much to everyone who has shared their data with us,
and allowed us to share the data with the broader research community; thanks too
to everyone who has worked on the project over the past four years.
