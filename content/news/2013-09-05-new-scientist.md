Title: PREDICTS in New Scientist!

This week's New Scientist
[has a piece](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929333.000-stop-global-warming-and-save-biodiversity-yes-we-can.html)
largely about the PREDICTS project, arising from Tim Newbold's talk
at INTECOL. Written by Michael Marshall, the piece weaves together
some strands from PREDICTS together with some discussion of
[Planetary Boundaries](http://www.stockholmresilience.org/planetary-boundaries).
Although it's a bit ahead of where we've actually got to with our
modelling (the online version is entitled "Stop global warming and
save biodiversity? Yes, we can"!), it's a nice and optimistic piece; there's also a
[brief editorial](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929332.000-biodiversity-keep-fighting-the-good-fight.html#.UiovkWR4a5M).
