Title: 100<sup>th</sup> study!

On 26<sup>th</sup> June, we uploaded to the PREDICTS database the
data from our 100<sup>th</sup> study. Susy Echeverr&iacute;a-Londo&ntilde;o
processed the data set -
[Navarro et al. (2011) Rev. Colombiana cienc. Anim.](http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3691401).
It's the 16<sup>th</sup> study she's found from Colombia, the
focus of her MRes project. That means Colombia is currently represented
by more studies than any other country, narrowly ahead of the USA
(15 studies) and UK (13 studies); 39 countries are represented so far.
The next milestones on the horizon are 10,000 species and half a million
records - both of which he hope to reach within the next few weeks.
