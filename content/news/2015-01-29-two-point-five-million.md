Title: PREDICTS database tops 2.5 million records

A huge study by [Rob Ewers](/pages/team.html#RE) from
[2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[96:SIBEAA]2.0.CO;2), just
uploaded by [Charlotte Chng](/pages/team.html#CC), has
pushed the database past 2.5 million records for the first time.
We now have 22,627 sites from 93 countries, and are rapidly closing
in on 40,000 species in the database - including over 6,000 beetle
species. Around half of our species are arthropods, and most of the
rest are plants. We are pushing hard to add studies to the database
in time for the first full release, which will be later this year.
Thanks as ever to everyone who has contributed!
