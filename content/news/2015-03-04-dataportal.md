Title: PREDICTS site-level summary data available via the NHM's data portal

PREDICTS site-level summary data are
[now available](http://dx.doi.org/10.5519/0018993)
through the Natural History Museum's [data portal](http://data.nhm.ac.uk/).
These data are a snapshot of the PREDICTS database as of March 2014
and were previously made available alongside the
[paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1303) that
describes how the database was put together.
The portal makes this dataset accessible via an easy-to-use
interactive interface - the map showing sampling locations is
a very nice way to explore the data.

The data portal, which is still in beta, allows anyone to explore,
download and reuse digitised data from the NHM's collections.
