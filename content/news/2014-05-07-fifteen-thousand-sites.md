Title: PREDICTS database passes 15,000 sites

In the last few minutes, the database has passed 15,000 sites.
[Helen Phillips](/pages/team.html#HP) uploaded data from
[Gray et al.'s recent paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1003)
on dung beetle assemblages in Sabah. This is also the
21<sup>st</sup> dataset we have from Malaysia, moving it level
with Canada and only one behind the UK and the USA - but still
some way behind Brazil, which leads the table with 40 studies.
