Title: Nature paper - Global effects of land use on local terrestrial biodiversity

The first fully global analysis of the PREDICTS database is published today
[in Nature](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14324). In brief:

* Human-driven land use has caused an estimated fall of 13.6% worldwide in
    average local species-richness
* Most of these losses occurred in the last century
* Future reductions are not inevitable: scenario analysis suggests
    that the last 50 years of losses could be reversed by 2100, if
    strong carbon markets are used to mitigate against climate change
* Our analysis included over 1.1 million records for nearly 27,000
    species at over 11,500 sites

A special issue of our
[newsletter]({filename}/newsletters/PREDICTSNewsletterSpring2015Special.pdf)
gives more detail. A [Q&A page]({filename}/pages/global_analysis_qanda.md) answers
some questions about the paper. There's a feature about the paper on the
[NHM website](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/our-work/biodiversity/big-data-on-biodiversity.html)
along with a
[news story](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2015/april/major-study-shows-biodiversity-losses-can-be-reversed134275.html)
and a
