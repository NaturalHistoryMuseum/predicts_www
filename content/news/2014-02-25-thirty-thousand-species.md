Title: 30,000 species!

Yesterday the PREDICTS database passed 30,000 species, thanks to
[Sara Contu](/pages/team.html#SC1) uploading a large study of Costa Rican
plants (by
[Mayfield et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01108.x).
The same study has taken us past 10,000 plant species. We're also
making good progress with geographic coverage - we now have 77
countries represented, the most recent additions being Chile,
Paraguay and French Guiana - all uploaded by
[David Laginha Pinto Correia](./pages/team.html#DLPC) within the last week.
We've started work on a manuscript describing the current state of the database
and how we put it together, and will soon be in touch with our data providers
about it.
