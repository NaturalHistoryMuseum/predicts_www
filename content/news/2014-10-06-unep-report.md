Title: PREDICTS models used in UNEP report

Our global estimates of the impact to date of human activities on
local biodiversity (which were
[featured last year in New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929333.000-stop-global-warming-and-save-biodiversity-yes-we-can))
were recently included in a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report
'Towards a global map of natural capital: key ecosystem assets'
(the full report [can be accessed for free](http://wcmc.io/e0fd)).
This report aimed to compile the best available
global data on the state of several components of ecosystems that
are known to be important to humans: water, soil, carbon and
biodiversity. The PREDICTS map was used to estimate the effect of
human activities on terrestrial biodiversity. This is the first
major policy output in which PREDICTS has played a role, and we
hope that we can provide input into similar processes in the future.
