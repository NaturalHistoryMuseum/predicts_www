Title: Summer project students

Welcome to this summer's project students (some of whom have
already been part of the team for a few weeks).
[Katia Sanchez Ortiz](/pages/team.html#KSO) will be
comparing responses of island and mainland sites to human impacts;
[Susan Emerson](/pages/team.html#SE) will similarly
comparing responses inside and outside biodiversity hotspots;
[Gwilym Pask-Hale](/pages/team.html#GPH) will be looking at
responses in African savanna systems;
[John Hughes](/pages/team.html#JH) is targeting New Zealand;
[Di Gao](/pages/team.html#DG) is focusing on China and
nearby countries; [Hanbin Zhang](/pages/team.html#HZ) is
concentrating on large and carnivorous mammals;
Joe Middleton-Welling is testing
how species' functional traits mediate how Lepidoptera respond to
impacts; and William Chan is doing a wide-scale analysis of how
organismal mass shapes species' responses.
