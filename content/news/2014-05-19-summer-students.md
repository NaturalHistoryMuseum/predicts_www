Title: Summer project students

Welcome to this summer's project students (some of whom have
already been part of the team for a few weeks).
[Katia Sanchez Ortiz]({filename}/pages/team.md#KSO) will be
comparing responses of island and mainland sites to human impacts;
[Susan Emerson]({filename}/pages/team.md#SE) will similarly
comparing responses inside and outside biodiversity hotspots;
[Gwilym Pask-Hale]({filename}/pages/team.md#GPH) will be looking at
responses in African savanna systems;
[John Hughes]({filename}/pages/team.md#JH) is targeting New Zealand;
[Di Gao]({filename}/pages/team.md#DG) is focusing on China and
nearby countries; [Hanbin Zhang]({filename}/pages/team.md#HZ) is
concentrating on large and carnivorous mammals;
Joe Middleton-Welling is testing
how species' functional traits mediate how Lepidoptera respond to
impacts; and William Chan is doing a wide-scale analysis of how
organismal mass shapes species' responses.
