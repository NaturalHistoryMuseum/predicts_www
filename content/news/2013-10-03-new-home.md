Title: New home for the Purvis lab

Andy Purvis, principal investigator on PREDICTS, and the rest of his research
group have moved from [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk) to
their new home at London's [Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk) -
all of his team are very excited to be there! His group will continue to work
closely with others at Imperial, particularly with the
[BioFrag](http://biofrag.wordpress.com/) team.
