Title: Land use pressures and changes impacting Europe's bees

[Adriana De Palma's](/pages/team.html#ADP) recently published
[paper in the Journal of Applied Ecology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12524/abstract)
focusses on how  European bees respond to land-use change. Adriana merged
PREDICTS data on abundance and diversity of bees in Europe with information on
species' ecological traits in order to ask whether species sensitivities to
land use pressures are significantly affected by their ecological traits.
Using data for 257 bee species at 1584 sites, Adriana found that species'
sensitivity to land use was most strongly influenced by foraging range and
flight season duration, but also by niche breadth, phenology and reproductive
strategy, with effects that differed among cropland, pastoral and urban habitats.
The results have a number of implications for which species should be targeted
by management activities and in what systems. For example, results showed that
small bodied pollen-specialists were particularly sensitive to intensive
agriculture, suggesting that although enhanced floral resources may help, they
will require careful placement with respect to foraging ranges of smaller bee
species. Thank you very much to everyone who has contributed data.
