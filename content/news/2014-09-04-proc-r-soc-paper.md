Title: First PREDICTS data analysis published open-access in Proceedings of the Royal Society

Our [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.1371)
presents the most comprehensive analysis of changes in the
structure of ecological communities in tropical and sub-tropical
forests as a result of land-use change, and the first analysis
from the PREDICTS Project. We show that the
biggest differences are in areas of human-dominated land uses,
with more people, more removal of vegetation by humans and less
forest cover. Importantly, we show that different species are
affected differently, with greater losses of narrowly distributed
species and species that specialize on forest habitat, and smaller
losses of widely distributed species that are less dependent on
forest habitat.
