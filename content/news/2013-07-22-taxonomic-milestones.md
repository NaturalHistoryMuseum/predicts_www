Title: Stop press - 3,000<sup>th</sup> plant, 1,000<sup>th</sup> lepidopteran and 500<sup>th</sup> hemipteran

In one of PREDICTS' busiest days for data, ten data sets (from seven
different papers) have already been uploaded today, and they've taken
us past 3,000 plant taxa, 1,000 taxa of Lepidoptera and 500 taxa of
Hemiptera. Most of the taxa are species, but our counts are inevitably
slightly approximate - not all authors have been able to identify
specimens to species level, so sometimes only higher level taxonomy is
reported. We try to verify the name using
[Catalogue of Life](http://www.catalogueoflife.org/), which
also returns information on the higher-level taxonomy.  The next data
milestones will be 150 ecoregions, 7,500 sites and 15,000 different taxa.
