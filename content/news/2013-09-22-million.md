Title: Thanks a million!

Our millionth biodiversity record has just gone into the PREDICTS
database. [Victoria Kemp]({filename}/pages/team.md#VK)
got us close with a large Canadian study of mites and Collembola,
and [Sam Hill]({filename}/pages/team.md#SH) reached
the milestone with a Cameroonian study of plants at fifty sites.
We currently have 348 data sets, with over 11,800 sites, spanning
67 countries and 182 ecoregions - with a total of 1,008,069
records. Huge thanks to everyone who has shared their data with us,
and to [all the team]({filename}/pages/team.md) who have been working
so hard all summer to collate it.
