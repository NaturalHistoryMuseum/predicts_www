Title: Congratulations to PREDICTS Masters students!

Congratulations to the Masters students who worked on PREDICTS this
summer, all of whom have done superbly.  On the Ecology, Evolution and
Conservation MSc, Hannah White (project title: The response of
temperate biodiversity to human land use and habitat degradation - do
species' traits affect vulnerability) was awarded a Merit and Helen
Phillips (project: Responses of biodiversity to land-use change - is
the biota of Asia more sensitive than other continents?) a Distinction.
On Quantitative Biology, Sean Tuck (project: Modelling the relationship
between local diversity and remotely-sensed vegetation indices: the
effect of spatio-temporal scale) obtained a Merit.  Michelle Harrison
(project - The response of phylogenetic diversity to palm oil and cocoa
plantations) secured a Distinction on the MSc in Taxonomy and
Biodiversity, and Luci Kirkpatrick (project - Using phylogenetically
derived measures to assess the impact of wild meat hunting in tropical
regions) likewise obtained a Distinction on the MRes in Biosystematics.
Well done to all of them!
