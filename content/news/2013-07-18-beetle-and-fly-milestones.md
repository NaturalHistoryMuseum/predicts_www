Title: 2,000<sup>th</sup> beetle and 1,000<sup>th</sup> fly hit the database

Data from ten papers were uploaded to the PREDICTS database today -
our busiest day yet. During the day, we reached several landmarks - the
200<sup>th</sup> dataset, the 7,000<sup>th</sup> site, but perhaps the
best were seeing the 2,000<sup>th</sup> beetle and the
1,000<sup>th</sup> true fly (Dipteran) go in.
Despite having the lion's share of the world's species, arthropods are
under-represented in many biodiversity indicators, largely because
vertebrate species are so much better known. Of the 13,000 species in
our database so far, nearly 8,000 are arthropods, 2,500 are higher
plants, and under 2,000 are vertebrates, so hopefully our results will
be a reasonable representation of what's happening; also, our sample
sizes are large enough for us to test whether responses to human
impacts differ among major clades.
