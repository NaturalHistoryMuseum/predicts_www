    people interacted with species' biology to determine which species

    globally – to the changes they face; at the same time, the
    taxonomic focus is broader, covering all groups for which we are

  Joseph studied the
 <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/training/msc-taxonomy/index.html">
  MSc in Taxonomy and Biodiversity
 </a> at Imperial College London
 and the Natural History Museum. He used the data in the PREDICTS database
 to establish correlates of
 extinction risk in Lepidoptera throughout the world. Joseph previously
 studied Biological Science at the
 <a href="http://www.uea.ac.uk/">University of East Anglia</a>, and
 is about to start a PhD at <a href="https://www.brookes.ac.uk/homepage/">Oxford Brookes University</a> looking into trait evolution and reponses to evironmental change in the Nymphalidae

<p itemprop="description">
 Gwilym attended the
 <a href="http://www.hull.ac.uk/">University of Hull</a> undertaking
 a bachelor degree in Zoology, specialising in modules focused on
 Evolution and Conservation. Before and during this degree he
 volunteered with a number of conservation organisations ranging from
 South African Game and Nature reserves to zoos specialising in rare
 species. Lessons from these experiences have given him a wide
 range of knowledge on conservation efforts and furthered his desire
 to work in conservation. To improve his knowledge base and skill-set
 he undertook an
 <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/training/msc-taxonomy/index.html">
  MSc in Taxonomy and Biodiversity
 </a> at Imperial College London. His project for PREDICTS
 investigated the relationship between size and extinction risk from
 human impacts.

<p itemprop="description">
  Maeve studied the
  <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/prospectus/graduate/environment-and-development">
    MSc in Environment and Development
  </a> at King's College London. Her project involved matching the major
  taxonomic groups used to classify species in PREDICTS to the functional
  groups used in the
  <a href="http://www.madingleymodel.org/">Madingley Model</a>,
  so that the two models can make predictions about the same aspects of the
  structure of ecological assemblages. Maeve previously studied at
  <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/">Trinity College Dublin</a> where she
  graduated with a degree in Environmental Science in 2013.

<p itemprop="description">
  Rebecca graduated from <a href="http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/">
  King's College, University of Cambridge</a>, where she studied
  Natural Sciences (Zoology). Rebecca was an intern in the Science programme of
  <a href="http://www.unep-wcmc.org/">UNEP-WCMC</a> working on PREDICTS.
  She modelled how species' traits such as seed mass, plant height and vertebrate
  body mass vary with land use change.

  Rebecca is now a PhD student at the
  <a href="http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/">University of Sheffield</a>,
  researching the impacts of selective logging on tropical climate refugia and the ectotherms that utilise them.
