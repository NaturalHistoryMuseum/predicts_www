PREDICTS - Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing
Terrestrial Systems - is a collaborative project aiming to use a meta-analytic
approach to investigate how local biodiversity typically responds to human
pressures such as land-use change, pollution, invasive species and
infrastructure, and ultimately improve our ability to predict future
biodiversity changes.

Human activities are causing major changes in biological communities worldwide,
and these changes can harm biodiversity and ecosystem function.
Ecosystem function is important in supporting plant and animal communities, as
well as ensuring the long-term survival of human populations. Understanding
how human pressures influence global biodiversity at a local scale can help
us make predictions of future changes, and can inform conservation policy at
national and global levels.

## We need more data!

The PREDICTS project is collecting data from scientists worldwide in order to
produce a global database of terrestrial species' responses to human pressures.

Thanks to generous contributions from researchers, and a great deal of hard work
by students and staff at the Natural History Museum and UNEP-WCMC, the project
now has over 2.5 million biodiversity records from over 21,000 sites, covering
more than 38,000 species.

If you have data that you would like to contribute, please look at our
[contribution page]({filename}/pages/contribute.md) for more information.
