Title: The science behind PREDICTS
Slug: the-science

PREDICTS will use a range of meta-analytical methods to quantify species- and
community-level responses to a range of human pressures including agriculture,
hunting, deforestation, introduction of invasive species and human population
expansion.

## Ecological attributes

Species do not all respond equally to human pressures such as land-use change,
exploitation and the introduction of invasive species. PREDICTS will model how
biodiversity responds to different anthropogenic pressures as a function not
only of the intensity of environmental pressure, but also of species' ecological
attributes. This will enable a more in-depth understanding of biodiversity loss,
and allow more accurate projections that can inform conservation policy.

Some of our models will therefore include key ecological attributes of species
(e.g., how large they are and whether they are geographically widespread or
local endemics) in interaction with measures of anthropogenic pressures
(e.g., type, intensity), to understand the response of biodiversity to different
intensities of human threats.

## Measures of biodiversity

PREDICTS will also investigate whether different components of terrestrial
biodiversity respond differently to anthropogenic change. Biodiversity
components of interest include: species richness, abundance, evenness, community
biomass, spatial turnover and functional diversity.

## Taxonomic groups

The project aims to include data from a wide variety of different taxonomic
groups, including vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. Indicators of
biodiversity declines have been heavily biased towards taxonomic groups that
appeal to many naturalists, such as birds. Different taxonomic groups may
respond differently to anthropogenic pressure, and it is important to include
as wide a range of species when considering global changes in biodiversity in
response to human impact.

## Geographical characteristics and scales

PREDICTS will investigate biodiversity responses at both a global and local
scale, including nation- and biome-specific responses. Certain geographical
regions and biomes have been neglected in studies of biodiversity declines, but
species responses to human pressures may vary between biomes. PREDICTS aims to
include data from all terrestrial biomes and geographical regions in order to
gain a more complete picture of human impacts on global biodiversity.

## Scientific aims

The PREDICTS framework will have the potential to separate the effects of
different drivers of change, test whether different biodiversity components and
taxonomic groups respond differently, and provide useful indicators at multiple
geographical scales. We will use it to answer both policy-relevant and
fundamental scientific questions such as:

1. What are the biodiversity consequences of socio-political scenarios for 2050,
    including those being developed for the next generation of IPCC reports?
2. How will different components of biodiversity respond to different scenarios?
3. Does biodiversity decline steadily as threats intensify, or are there strong
    threshold effects?
4. Does biodiversity that is known to directly underpin selected ecosystem
    services show unusual responses compared with broad-sense biodiversity?
