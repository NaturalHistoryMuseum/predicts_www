Despite being important for ecosystem function, below-ground organisms are
rarely the focus of Citizen Science projects. Earthworms are the most accessible
of soil invertebrates - ubiquitous, easy to find and of known importance in soil
productivity, carbon storage and flood mitigation.

Earthworm Watch is a Citizen Science project aiming to improve knowledge of how
humans affect earthworms and how this influences soil health. The project
launched April 2016 and is expected to run for at least two years - focussing on
spring and autumn to coincide when earthworms are most active.

## Project Background

Earthworms are known to influence soil carbon storage, plant productivity and
rates of water drainage but mapping the benefits they provide is not yet
possible because earthworm distribution and diversity is under-studied<sup>1</sup>.
Data from urban soils is particularly lacking, despite gardens and other green
spaces making up a large percentage of urban space, (e.g., 14% of Greater
London<sup>2</sup>). Globally, soils store approximately 80% of terrestrial
carbon<sup>3</sup> but the UK's carbon stock in domestic garden soils has not
been quantified, and the effects of human management on this stock - and on the
other benefits earthworms provide - are yet to be studied.

Earthworm Watch will map key ecosystem benefits - productivity, flood mitigation
and carbon storage - that are mediated by earthworms in the UK, now and under
different possible future land-management scenarios. The survey will include
optional experiments to test how gardens and other urban green spaces can be
managed to promote earthworm populations and enhance the benefits they provide.

## Study design

The survey requires digging a soil pit in two areas of different habitat e.g.,
lawn/flowerbed (pictured) or management e.g., mulched/unmulched. For each soil
pit the habitat, number and types of earthworms, and soil properties are
recorded. This paired study design controls for differences in effort and ability
between participants, avoiding the main problem with analysing citizen science
data.

In addition, participants have the opportunity to do an experiment by making a
change to one of the two plots (e.g., adding nutrients in the form of vegetable
waste) waiting a month, and then sampling both plots.

## Scientific aims

The new surveys undertaken by citizen scientists
will provide suitably structured data to answer
the following questions:

* How do abundance and functional diversity of earthworms respond to different
    land use and land management as well as to other environmental gradients
    (e.g., soil moisture, texture)?
* How do three key ecosystem benefits mediated by earthworms - soil carbon
    storage, soil productivity and flood mitigation - vary geographically across
    the U.K.; and what is the total carbon stock in UK domestic garden soils?
* Do these ecosystem benefits co-vary positively (forming ecosystem service
    'bundles') or negatively (implying trade-offs), and does the answer depend
    on spatial scale?
* What land management approaches are conducive to earthworm assemblages that
    provide good levels of ecosystem services?
* How are earthworms and the ecosystem services they mediate projected to
    respond to future scenarios of land-use change?

## Analysis

We will use mixed-effects models (as used in [4]) to focus on comparisons
between plots sampled by the same participant to model earthworm abundance
and diversity and to estimate soil carbon across the U.K. Maps of ecosystem
benefits will be generated by combining data on water tables, soil type and
climate with relationships between earthworm assemblages, soil fertility and
drainage rates.

## Audience and outputs

There has been pressure for a policy for improvements in soil quality (as has
been seen for water and air) and the results of this project will feed into the
necessary underpinning science. The project will inform management outcomes on
both a local scale for gardeners and allotment holders, and on a city scale to
inform policy decisions on urban landscape planning. In particular, there is a
recognised need to understand factors determining carbon storage in U.K. soils
and to improve our understanding of the relationships between soil carbon and
soil health. The impact on participants will be to enthuse and inform them on
the value of the life beneath their feet and its importance for the wider
environment - they will also gain first-hand experience of the scientific
process.

An additional incentive for participants will be the opportunity for
acknowledgement in outputs, in the form of a massively co-authored publication
on the database to be submitted to the Biodiversity Data Journal, and have their
name against data in the
[Natural History Museum Data Portal](http://data.nhm.ac.uk/).
Particularly keen citizen scientists will be invited to participate in writing
papers on the less analytic aspects of the project.

## The Team
Earthworm Watch is a partnership between the
[Earthwatch Institute](http://eu.earthwatch.org/) and the
[Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/) in association with the
[Earthworm Society of Britain](http://www.earthwormsoc.org.uk/).
