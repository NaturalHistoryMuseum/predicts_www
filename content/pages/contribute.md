Title: Contributing to the PREDICTS project
Slug: contribute

The PREDICTS project is collating data from published papers, but ecologists and
conservationists often hold more substantial and detailed data than there is
room to publish in standard papers. If you have data that you think might be
suitable, we would love to hear from you!

We are looking for diversity or community composition data collected from more
than one terrestrial site using a standardised methodology. If you have
published data of this type and can provide us with additional detail, the
contribution process is simple and easy.

In particular the data we are looking for is as follows:

* Locations of sampling points, as precisely as possible (with the coordinate
    system used, if possible)
* An indication of the type of land cover that each sampling point represents
    (e.g. primary forest, secondary forest, intensively-farmed crop, hedgerow)
* An indication of how intensively the site is used by people
* Data on the presence / absence, or ideally a measure of abundance, of each
    species at each site
* The date(s) that each measurement was taken

If you are interested in contributing to the PREDICTS project, please complete
[our form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13JGRgDAT7Fvv8vxpM_fQZk3Jl4YEmp5yRwYLQEYMJ3o/viewform)
to send details of your data. We will do our best to respond promptly.
Thanks to the generous contributions of many people we have a large backlog of
datasets that we have not yet had time to process, so we will not be able to
incorporate new datasets quickly.

### Authorship and dissemination of data

We are only able to use data that you are willing for us to make publicly
available at least 18 months after receiving it. Contributors of data uploaded
to the database by mid-2015 will be offered authorship on an open-access paper
accompanying the first public release of the database, and will be acknowledged
appropriately in all other publications for the project. We envisage publishing
later updates to the database, again open-access, that will provide
opportunities for later contributors to the database to be recognised with
authorship. We recognise that there may be extremely good conservation reasons
for not fully releasing species identities or plot localities in some instances.
In such cases, we are of course willing to coarsen the information made
available to the public.

## Take-down policy

The PREDICTS project operates a 'take-down' policy, such that if we are notified
of a potential breach of copyright, or a possible violation of any law
(including but not limited to laws on copyright, patent, intellectual property,
trademark, confidentiality, data protection), the complete dataset or relevant
portion will be removed from the database as quickly as possible pending further
investigation.

Where the grounds for complaint are found to be valid, the complete dataset or
relevant portion will be permanently deleted.

If you have discovered any material in the PREDICTS database which you consider
to breach copyright or any other law, please contact
[enquiries@predicts.org.uk](mailto:enquiries@predicts.org.uk)
with the following information:

Your contact details

* The details of the dataset or relevant portion of the dataset
* The nature of your complaint or concern
* An assertion that your complaint is made in good faith and is accurate
* If you are complaining about breach of your own copyright or other
    intellectual property right, please also confirm that you are the rights
    owner or are authorised to act for the rights owner.
