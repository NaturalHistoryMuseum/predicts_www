Title: Q&amp;A about Nature paper - Global effects of land use on local terrestrial biodiversity

### Have 13% of species gone extinct?
No – it's important to note that we haven't considered the global loss
of species. Our focus is on diversity within local ecosystems. In some
ways, that's more important, because the ability of an ecosystem to
provide us with what we need – food, fibres, recreation and so on –
depends more on local diversity than on what's happening globally.

### How bad is a 13% reduction?
The evidence suggests that most ecosystems can still provide many of the
things we need even if they lose some of their species, but that they
often start to break down badly when losses reach around 20%, after
which people need to pay for things that biodiversity used to provide
for free. For example, biodiverse landscapes have built-in control of
pests and weeds, but we need to spend money to achieve these in
species-poor systems. We estimate that over a quarter of the world's
land surface has passed the 20% point already.

### Why does the paper not model the effects of climate change on biodiversity?
We've used spatial comparisons – between sites that are close together
but face different pressures – making the assumption that the
differences in diversity are driven by the differences in pressures.
This is reasonable for looking at land-use change, because we have
badly-damaged sites near to intact ones. But climate change affects
much wider areas than land-use change, meaning we can't sample nearby
sites that differ much in how much climate change they've experienced.

### What's next for PREDICTS?
We have already started getting things ready for the full database
release, and the associated paper, which we're looking to submit in the
summer. We're also using the data in a range of analyses focusing on
particular taxa (bees, mammals), regions (e.g., South America) or land
uses (e.g, protected areas, plantation forests). In the longer term,
we've also had more funding from NERC to extend the PREDICTS framework
to include datasets that sample sites before and after a change in
human impacts, which will let us test a range of hypotheses about how
land-use change reshapes ecological assemblages over time.
