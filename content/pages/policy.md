Title: Local Biodiversity Intactness Index
Slug: policy

The Local Biodiversity Intactness Index is based on a purpose-built global
database of local biodiversity surveys combined with high resolution global
land-use data. The index provides estimates of human impacts on the intactness
of local biodiversity worldwide, and how this may change over time.

## Definition, purpose and relation to other indicators

The Local Biodiversity Intactness Index (LBII) estimates how much of a
terrestrial site's original biodiversity remains in the face of human land use
and related pressures. Because LBII relates to site-level biodiversity, it can
be averaged and reported for any larger spatial scale (e.g., countries,
biodiversity hotspots or biomes as well as globally) without additional
assumptions. Building on research published recently in *Nature*<sup>1</sup>,
and repurposing existing biodiversity survey data, it combines scientific rigour
with affordability. The LBII is particularly relevant for Aichi Targets 12
(Preventing Extinctions) and 14 (Essential Ecosystem Services).
Existing indicators for these targets lack a broad biodiversity perspective; in
particular, they are heavily biased towards vertebrates, which make up only 0.5%
of the world's species and relate to only simple biodiversity measures.
The LBII can report on both species-richness and mean abundance, and is being
developed further to also report on geographic range rarity (endemism) and
phylogenetic diversity. LBII is strongly complementary to the proposed
Biodiversity Habitat Index (BHI). LBII's focus is on average local biotic
intactness, which reflects species' persistence within the landscape and the
local ecosystem's ability to provide many ecosystem services; BHI, by contrast,
focuses on how the overall diversity of a larger region is hit by habitat loss
and degradation (Target 5). LBII was first proposed in 2005<sup>2</sup> but the
data needed to make it operational have only now been brought together.

## Coverage and resolution

The LBII covers the world's entire terrestrial realm, and can report both
globally and at any smaller scale relevant for global policy (see Figure 1).
Although published analyses have so far had coarse spatial and temporal
grain[1](), CSIRO's development of annual, global, fine-scale land-use maps
allows LBII to report annually at 1km resolution from 2001 to 2020.

## The underpinning science

The LBII is based on rigorously peer-reviewed and transparent science.
The global statistical models were published recently in Nature[1](), along with
global maps of net changes in local biodiversity by 2005, a hindcast of change
from 1500-2005, and global and national projections of future changes under the
Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (Figure 2).

2095; LBII additionally discounts species not in the original assemblage.
Future projections are based on the four Representative Concentration Pathway
scenarios<sup>6</sup>. Grey shading and error bars show 95% confidence intervals
(from Newbold et al. 2015 Nature 520:45-50.)

Models of how land use affects the similarity of an ecological community to that
of intact sites are now in review<sup>3</sup>; a paper combining these with our earlier
models to map LBII is in preparation. These models all use the PREDICTS
database<sup>4</sup>, which has collated data from studies that compared terrestrial
biodiversity at sites facing different intensities of human pressures; it
currently holds over 3 million records for over 26,000 sites (in 94 countries)
and a taxonomically representative set of over 45,000 plant, invertebrate and
vertebrate species (Figure 3).

These data, contributed by a network of over 500 researchers worldwide, will be
made freely available in the coming months (some metadata are already
available<sup>5</sup>). The database will continue to grow, enabling more precise
modeling. Annual land-use data since 2001 are produced by using remotely-sensed
land cover change data to statistically downscale global land-use maps to 1km
resolution; a paper is in preparation.

# The team

The database and statistical models have been developed by the PREDICTS project
(www.predicts. org.uk), a collaboration between the
[Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk), London UK,
[UNEP-WCMC](http://www.unep-wcmc.org)
and several British universities that has been endorsed by
[GEO BON](http://geobon.org/). The global, annual, fine-scale land-use data have
been developed by [CSIRO](www.csiro.au).
