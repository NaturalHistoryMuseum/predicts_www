      The response of phylogenetic diversity to palm oil and cocoa
      plantations.
    </h4>

      <p>
      Tropical biodiversity is under threat from many anthropogenic
      causes, including deforestation
      and habitat degradation. Palm oil and cocoa are two economically
      important plantation crops that
      occur in the tropical biome. The industries differ in their management
      practices. Palm oil
      cultivation is intense and involves the clear felling of forest and
      subsequent planting of palms,
      followed by repeated application of agricultural chemicals. Cocoa
      cultivation requires the thinning
      of primary forest and under-planting of cocoa seedlings. Use of
      herbicide is not as intense as in
      the palm oil industry. These management practices may have differing
      impacts on biodiversity.
      Most studies on this type of land use have been conducted using species-
      neutral diversity
      indices, which don't take into account phylogenetic relatedness within
      a community. The aim of
      my study was to use phylogenetic diversity indices to provide a measure
      of how much
      evolutionary history and character diversity is lost from communities
      in response to threat.
      </p>

      <p>
      Using 17 datasets provided by authors of papers in the current
      literature, I constructed
      phylogenetic trees for the communities, pruning each one to reflect the
      community composition
      at plantation and primary forest sites. I derived three phylogenetic
      diversity indices, Faith's
      phylogenetic diversity, and Helmus' phylogenetic species richness and
      phylogenetic species
      evenness. I also recorded the species richness. Using linear mixed-
      effects models, I modeled
      the response of these indices, in higher taxonomic groups, to a number
      of explanatory threat
      variables.
      </p>

      <p>
      The main findings of my study were that higher taxonomic groups showed
      differing responses to
      the two plantation types. Tree and liana phylogenetic diversity
      exhibited a significant decrease on
      conversion of primary forest to both types of plantation, although this
      was much more
      pronounced in palm oil plantations. There was a significant negative
      impact on vertebrate
      phylogenetic diversity in palm oil plantations, but not in cocoa
      plantations. Overall, arthropod
      diversity was not significantly affected by either plantation type.
      These results suggest that the
      management practices used in cocoa plantations allow the habitat to
      maintain a larger proportion
      of tree, liana and vertebrate diversity than palm oil plantations.
      Modifying palm oil management
      practice to incorporate elements of cocoa cultivation practice may help
      to increase the levels of
      diversity that palm oils can support.

      <p>
      Hunting is now a greater threat to biodiversity in tropical regions
      than deforestation, with wildlife abundance more tightly correlated
      with hunting patterns than with habitat area or forest type. Hunting
      has increased to several orders of magnitude higher than sustainable
      levels in the last decade, particularly in Africa. Often large scale
      conservation efforts or studies focus on particular charismatic
      species (e.g. the apes) or particular National Park areas and only
      consider metrics of diversity such as species richness or endemism.
      However not all species are equal, with related species often share
      underlying traits, niches and ecological interactions, and distantly
      related species adding more evolutionary history to a community than
      closely related ones. Using hunting proxies I designed based on the
      average body mass and average age to sexual maturity of species at a
      site I explored the effect of hunting on three measures of
      phylogenetic diversity: Faiths PD, phylogenetic species richness
      (PSR), phylogenetic species evenness (PSE) and species richness
      (SR). In line with other studies heavy hunting pressure was found
      within 16km of population points, outside of which the average body
      mass of the site increased. Average body mass of a site acted as a
      suitable proxy for hunting pressure but average age to sexual
      maturity was less successful. PD, PSR and SR were lowest in heavily
      hunted sites near to population points and highest furthest from
      population points in sites with an average body mass of about 19.5kg,
      PD, PSR and SR correlated strongly with PSR being the most sensitive
      metric for hunting pressure. PSE was low in sites with high PSR
      suggesting the most phylogenetically diverse sites are those with few
      abundant species and many rare species, potentially rendering the
      rare species vulnerable to anthropogenic pressure. Finally this study
      demonstrates the importance of global collaborations in ecology and
      conservation as by using the Tropical Ecosystem Assessment and
      Monitoring network, as well as satellite data on populations and
      canopy cover it was possible to predict the effects of hunting on
      local community structure.

        Responses of biodiversity to land-use change: Is the biota of Asia
        more sensitive than other continents?

      Following from a recent meta-analysis, which reported Asia's biota as
      being the most sensitive to habitat change, I investigated the
      responses
      of the biota of different continents. The decline in abundance when
      primary forests were compared with plantation forests showed that South
      America had the largest decline. When secondary forests were compared
      with plantation forests, Asia and Africa had a decline, but South
      America
      had an increase. When using a continuous predictor of habitat quality,
      enhanced vegetation index (EVI), South America showed the greatest
      decline in abundance with declining quality. Thus this study suggests
      that rather than Asia, it is South America's biota that is most sensitive
      to habitat disturbance and land-use change.

        Biodiversity is being lost at an alarming rate and the intensity of
        environmental pressures behind the decline show no sign of abating.
        Many limitations of biodiversity indicators are shared: models relate
        the response of biodiversity components to mechanisms of
        environmental change, but are often data deficient and assign
        qualitative classifications to intensities of change. By utilising
        remotely- sensed MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), quantitative
        measures of habitat destruction intensity can be globally applied at
        local scales and related to local biodiversity. The spatio-temporal
        scale of EVI data must be large enough to capture environmental
        dynamics acting upon local biodiversity, but not so large as to
        include irrelevant dynamics: the optimal scale at which EVI can be
        related to local abundance is unclear. This study aims to: devise a
        method for MODIS remotely- sensed data to be retrieved and applied to
        statistical modelling, and; identify an optimal spatio- temporal
        scale of EVI for globally modelling local responses of abundance to
        environmental change. An R package – MODISTools – was developed to
        improve access and implementation of MODIS data to statistical
        modelling, and is available for download. MODISTools was used to
        retrieve EVI, which was related to local abundance using Generalized
        Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) and Generalized Additive Mixed Models (
        GAMMs). Abundance data were a pooled collection from publications in
        the literature, producing abundances for many species in many
        locations: space was a surrogate for time, looking at the local
        relationship within each site, among many sites, building a global
        response. Random effects account for differences between studies,
        locations, and species. EVI data were spatially-weighted using a
        Gaussian kernel function. Effects of spatio-temporal scale were
        explored by fitting the model to data of varying scales and using
        model comparison via AIC and parameter estimates. EVI was considered
        within increasingly larger spatial extents to compare with smaller
        scales, and repeated for increasingly larger temporal extents, to
        find a scale that maximises model fit and provides meaningful
        parameter estimates for inference. Results show that the effects of
        scale are complex; AIC marginally decreases for increased spatial
        extents with little difference between temporal scales containing
        sufficient data. But spatial dependency in EVI parameters produce
        scales that are the best fit but poorly represent local dynamics. At
        low temporal scales AIC is unreliable but parameter estimates provide
        an increasingly detailed description of local dynamics with
        increasing spatial extent. Larger temporal scales facilitate more
        quality EVI data, allowing better discrimination between sites, but
        include dynamics irrelevant to the local response. Whereas, smaller
        temporal scales are data deficient in some locations, but where data
        is reliable, a more detailed response is elucidated and increasing
        spatial extent improves parameter estimates. In conclusion, there is
        a trade-off between model fit and a detailed description of local
        dynamics that must be met by balancing spatial and temporal scales.
        All models show high mean EVI has a positive effect on local
        abundance, but a nonlinear threshold effect is identified with
        locally scaled EVI.

      The Response of Temperate Biodiversity to Human Land Use and Habitat
      Degradation: Do Species' Traits Affect Vulnerability?
    </h4>

    <div id="hw_2012" style="display: none">
      <p>
      Land use change in temperate biomes has been occurring since the
      arrival of humans into these regions, and increased anthropogenic
      pressures have led to an unprecedented amount of modification to
      primary habitats which greatly affect biodiversity and community
      composition. This project aimed to look at the effects of land use and
      habitat degradation on species abundances using both remotely-sensed
      and on-the-ground data at the individual site level, and investigate
      the influence of species' traits on their response. Biodiversity showed
      lower abundances in more degraded habitats, although responses differed
      between taxonomic groups. Body mass, age at sexual maturity, trophic
      level and geographic range were found to influence the response of
      birds and mammals to habitat degradation differently, whereas species
      with a narrower diet appeared more vulnerable to habitat degradation
      than omnivores in both taxonomic groups. The results of this study
      could contribute to effective biodiversity indicator design in order to
      realise the full extent of the current pressures we are placing on
      biodiversity.
