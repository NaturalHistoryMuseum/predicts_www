# www_predicts
Website for the PREDICTS project

The source code for the website is held within the `predicts_www` repository
on github at [predicts_www](www.github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/predicts_www).
The `predicts.org.uk` domain is leased through [uk2.net](www.uk2.net).
Static content generation
The site uses [Bootswatch readable](http://bootswatch.com/readable/)
for Bootstrap, via the
[pelican-bootstrap3](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3)
theme.

If you want to edit content on the website, first follow the
instructions on [Setup.md](setting up your computer for development).
Then read about [Release.md](releasing the website).
